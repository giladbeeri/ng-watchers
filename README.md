## ng-watchers

Counting watchers on an AngularJS app might be tricky as
[batarang](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/angularjs-batarang/ighdmehidhipcmcojjgiloacoafjmpfk?hl=en) provides
an overview of all watchers but makes the webpage **dead slow**.

By simply including `ng-watchers` as a `devDependency` you can simply get an overview of the watchers on the DOM
by calling `ngwatchers()`, that's it!
